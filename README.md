### Quickly enable/disable Google Chrome extensions

Tired of having too many extensions in your toolbar? Try Extensity, the ultimate tool

* Turn all extensions off (and back on) with a single click.
* Quick switch between several extensions groups using the Profiles feature.
* Allow your most important extensions to be always enabled.
